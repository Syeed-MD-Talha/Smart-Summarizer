# Smart Summarizer

A simple text summarization web application built using **FastAPI** and the **T5** model from Hugging Face. This app allows users to input text and receive a concise summary generated by the T5 model.

## Features

- **Text Summarization**: Uses the pre-trained `t5-small` model to generate summaries from user-provided text.
- **Web Interface**: A clean, minimal web interface built with FastAPI to handle requests.
- **REST API**: Summarization functionality available via API endpoints.

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python, based on standard Python type hints.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: A powerful library for pre-trained transformer models, including T5 for text generation.
- **Jinja2**: Templating engine used to serve HTML pages.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the basic structure and styling of the web page.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.7+** installed.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Syeed-MD-Talha/Smart-Summarizer.git
   cd Smart-Summarizer
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
   myenv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   You may need to install the following packages:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn transformers jinja2
   ```

### Running the Application

1. To start the application, run the following command:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   The server will start, and you can access the app at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2. Navigate to the root URL `/` to interact with the summarization functionality through a web interface.

### API Endpoints

- **GET /**: Renders the main HTML page for the summarization tool.
- **POST /summarize**: Accepts a JSON object with the text to be summarized. The expected request format is:
  ```json
  {
    "text": "Your text here."
  }
  ```
  The response will include the summarized version of the input text:
  ```json
  {
    "summary": "Summarized text."
  }
  ```

## Example

1. **Input**:
   ```json
   {
     "text": "Artificial intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of 'intelligent agents': any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals."
   }
   ```

2. **Output**:
   ```json
   {
     "summary": "AI is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. AI textbooks define it as the study of intelligent agents."
   }
   ```
